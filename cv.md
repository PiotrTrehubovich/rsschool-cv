## About me

Hi, my name is Piotr. I am 26 years old. Starting last year, I decided to change my career to a Front-end engineer. Since that time, I have received theoretical and practical knowledge in such fields as *HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Figma, React* and etc., and continue to develop my knowledge on a daily basis. I know the following languages: English (B2), German (B2), Polish (A2), Russian/Belarussian (Native). Also, I was involved in a couple of StartUp projects, which gives me a good foundation as a Junior/trainee Frontend engineer.

I am sure, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
